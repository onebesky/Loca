gives you basic information about your code, such as number of lines of code,
number of functions, number of lines of comments and other information.

Unzip the project to your webroot or project. You also need SQlite PHP module.
Thats. It.

# Usage

indexing files right after the project is created. It is good idea to filter
files and folders coming from third parties clicking filter button in file
explorer.
