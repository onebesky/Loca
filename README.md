# Loca

Loca is simple to use lines of code analyzer. The tool is easy to install and
gives you basic information about your code, such as number of lines of code,
number of functions, number of lines of comments and other information.

# Installation

Unzip the project to your webroot or project.
Make sure that directories /assets, /protected/data and /protected/runtime
are writable.

# Requirements
PHP 5.1+
SQLite PHP module

# Usage
Project is created on the first access (http://yourserver/loca). Loca starts
indexing files right after the project is created. It is good idea to filter
files and folders coming from third parties clicking filter button in file
explorer.
